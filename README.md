This lightweight application aims to showcase how easy it can be to get an isomorphic app started.
Check out the [demo](https://isomorphic-proof-of-concept.github.pablosichert.de/)! Uses
- [Riot](http://riotjs.com/) as view engine (client and server side)
- [Redux](http://rackt.org/redux/) for application state handling
- [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) for client side routing
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for server side routing

## Quick Installation and Start
